### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Container Image Vulnerability on Kubernetes Cluster
---

This incident type refers to the discovery of a security vulnerability in a container image running on a Kubernetes cluster. Container images are commonly used to package and deploy software applications in a lightweight and portable way. Kubernetes is a popular platform for managing containerized applications. A vulnerability in a container image can potentially expose the application and the underlying infrastructure to security threats. This incident requires immediate attention to identify and remediate the vulnerability to prevent any further security breaches.

### Parameters
```shell
export CLUSTER_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export POD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export IMAGE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export DEPLOYMENT="PLACEHOLDER"

export NAMESPACE="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_IMAGE="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug


### Check the status of the nodes in the cluster
```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

### Check the status of the pods running in the cluster
```shell
kubectl get pods
```

### Check the events related to a particular pod
```shell
kubectl describe pod ${POD_NAME}
```

### Check the container image used by a pod
```shell
kubectl describe pod ${POD_NAME} | grep Image
```

### Check the vulnerabilities in a container image
```shell
# Once inside the container, run:

apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh

trivy image ${IMAGE_NAME}
```

## Repair

### Upgrade the container image to the latest version with the vulnerability patched or fixed.
```shell

#!/bin/bash

# Set variables

NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}

DEPLOYMENT=${DEPLOYMENT}

NEW_IMAGE=${NEW_IMAGE}

# Upgrade container image to latest version

kubectl set image deployment/$DEPLOYMENT *=$NEW_IMAGE -n $NAMESPACE

```
